      <p>When it comes to web design, I absolutely love it. I have been designing websites through platforms such as Wix and Webflow, but I've found them to be tedious when you don't know how to code. It always took me forever to get the elements to display the way I intended them to. Learning to code from scratch makes it so much easier for me to make websites. I now have the freedom and flexibility to bring my ideas to life efficiently.</p>

	  <p>Web design is a huge part of my life and has been my passion for years. However, not being able to code always held me back. I even had to turn down offers to build websites because I struggled with understanding the underlying structure. Now, with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS training, I'm now confident that I can start selling my services for projects.</p>

	  <p>Not only am I am excited to get started with freelancing web design services, but I also can get back to creating a solid ePortfolio and ecommerce websites. Helping out people I care about with their online presence is also high on my list.</p>

	  <p>Learning everything was a tough experience. Developing websites for assignments involved a lot of trial and error to get the elements just right. Typing comments throughout the process definitely helped me understand and improve with each iteration.</p>

	  <p>Learning the basics has made a significant improvement in my understanding of coding overall. I'm excited about the journey ahead and can't wait to continue creating more websites.</p>
